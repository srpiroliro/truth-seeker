# truth seeker
A project which last year in collab with @esteve11, I decided to do "remake" and improve several aspects.

Currently works only on ABC... tests.

## How to use?

### Configuring
#### Enable the extension
The checkbox of "Enable the extension" is made so that you can hide/view the results/answers.

#### Setting the url
The url must point to where the server.py is run.

#### Setting the username
By default, each user has a random username consisting of 44 random characters, if you want to make so that other user can identify you, you need to change your username.

#### Changing the opacity
By changing the opacity bar value, you will change the opacity of the percentages shown in the answers. 

### Getting the answers

In each question you can see a `(i)` element which when clicked, will retrieve the answers from the server.

The answers will appear as percentages with the same `(i)` element. When hovering this element, you will see the list of people who picked this option.
